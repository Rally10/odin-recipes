            <li>1 ½ lbs lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons seasoning salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 slices of cheese</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>lettuce</li>
            <li>tomato</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>ketchup</li>
            <li>mustard</li>
            <li>mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to make</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high). In a large bowl,
                add the meat. Sprinkle evenly with Worcestershire sauce,
                seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper. Use your hands to mix
                the ingredients until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the meat mixture into quarters. Take 1/4 of the meat
                mixture and use your hands to press it into the shape of a patty
                that is 3/4 inch thick. Make an indentation in the center of the
                patty to prevent it from bulging in the center of the patty as
                it cooks. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture, making 4
                patties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the burgers on the grill. Cook 5 minutes on the first
                side. Flip the burgers and cook 5 more minutes, until the
                burgers reach the desired doneness.
            </li>
            <li>
                If adding cheese, put a slice of cheese on each patty about 1
                minute before removing the burgers from the grill to give the
                cheese a chance to melt.
            </li>
            <li>Serve burgers on buns with optional burger toppings.</li>
        </ol>
