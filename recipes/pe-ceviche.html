        <h3>Steps to make</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To begin, wash the fish with plenty of cold water and then cut
                it into cubes of about 1.5 cm. Then add salt and pepper to taste
                and let it rest at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime, peel and slice the onion and wash it in cold
                salted water. You can also let it soak for about 10 minutes
                before rinsing.
            </li>
            <li>Next, squeeze the lemons and reserve the juice in a bowl.</li>
            <li>
                Next, wash the aji limo, remove the seeds and veins and cut it
                into thin strips or small squares.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then remove the fish from the refrigerator, add the lime juice,
                chili lime and chopped culantro. Stir gently until the lime
                reaches all the fish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally add the onions, give a final stir and adjust the
                seasoning. Leave to marinate for a maximum of 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy immediately with the garnish of your choice. Garnish with
                sliced aji limo or rocoto bell pepper strips.
            </li>
